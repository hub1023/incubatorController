 Incubator Controller â€“ STM32

This project is an Egg Incubator Controller powered by an STM32 microcontroller, designed to regulate and automate the incubation process. The system regulates temperature, humidity, egg turning, and ventilation, with both automatic and manual operation modes.


Project Goals

This project aims to:
1.	Implement a state machine for efficient incubation control.
2.	Leverage ChatGPT for CI/CD in a manual engineering workflow, including:

  	-- Code Review: Regularly reviewing code with ChatGPT to identify issues and improve quality.

    -- Unit Test Generation: Using ChatGPT to generate unit tests for core functions.

    -- Error Log Analysis: Debugging issues by analyzing error logs with ChatGPT.

    -- Automating Documentation: Streamlining documentation processes.

    -- Comparing Development Time: Evaluating project completion time with and without AI assistance.

    -- Optimizing Prompting Strategies: Refining prompts to generate code aligned with best coding practices.

This project explores the integration of AI in embedded systems development to enhance efficiency and maintainability.
